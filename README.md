### 3D printable Staresso Basic's tools and utilities.

I'm currently designing some tools that help making a better coffee cup with the [Staresso Basic](https://staresso.com/collections/portable-espresso-maker/products/sp200) coffee maker. These tools should also work with Staresso Mini too as they are sharing the same body.

This is my first project that I design 3D models from beginning by myself.

Tools that I'm going to make:

- [x] Dosing ring

- [x] Tamper

- [x] Holder

I will eventually update the STL files to thingiverse.com too.
